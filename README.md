Marble Solitaire is a puzzle game. You start with 37 holes, and 36 marbles. You win by getting rid of all of the marbles except for one. You eliminate a marble by jumping it with another marble. Onceg you are unable to jump anymore the game is over and you cound how many marbles remain. The lower your score the better.

# Future Work

* It will allow you to move to any square that is a jump away, even if there isn't a marble to jump (no cheating!)
* A tradition Marble Solitaire board has a rim around the edge where you place the marbles once they've been one. Add a place for the marbles to go where you can see how many you've won. 
* Simplifying the code.
